I'm an embedded software engineer with a passion for controls engineering and
teaching software/controls engineering to high schoolers in the [FIRST Robotics
Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc).

Most of my free time is devoted to writing software for robotic applications.
I contribute to [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib), I wrote a
[book](https://github.com/calcmogul/controls-engineering-in-frc) on modern
control theory, and I do [numerical optimization
R&D](https://github.com/SleipnirGroup/Sleipnir).
